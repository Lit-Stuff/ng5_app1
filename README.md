## Getting started
```bash
git clone https://github.com/edison7476/ng5_app.git
cd ng5_app
npm install
npm start
```

## Useful Commands
  * `npm start` - starts a dev server and opens browser with running app
  * `npm run test` - runs lint and tests
  * `npm run watch` - runs tests in watch mode
  * `npm run prod` - runs full prod build and serves prod bundle
  * `npm run prettier` - runs prettier to format whole code base (`.ts` and `.scss`) 
  * `npm run analyze` - runs full prod build and `webpack-bundle-analyzer` to visualize how much code is shipped (dependencies & application) 


## Make It Your Own
When using this starter project to build your own app you might consider some of the following steps:
  
  * use `search and replace` functionality of your favourite IDE to replace `anms` with `<your-app-prefix>`
  * rename app in `src/environments/` files (will be shown in browser tab)
  * replace logo in `src/assets` folder ( currently 128 x 128 pixel `png` file )
  * adjust colors in `src/themes/default-theme.scss`
  
#### Continuous Integration
Starter project is using [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/) for running linters and tests on every commit.
Based on your preferences and needs you can either:

  * not use / use other CI server and delete both `.travis.yml` and `.travis-deploy.sh`
  * create Travis CI account and link it to your projects Github repo and [configure build](https://medium.com/@tomastrajan/continuous-deployment-of-client-side-apps-with-github-pages-travis-ci-10e9d641a889) 
    with `GH_REF` and `GH_TOKEN` environment variables for automatic deployment of releases to Github Pages
